This is derivative work from https://github.com/angelozerr/jdt-codemining

It has been significantly simplified to provide fewer options to users as well as provide
a runtime weaver used in MyEclipse 2018 to fix a minor refresh bug in the underlying 
JFace CodeMining support.  The opions removed were very cool, however, due to oddities experienced
when using the tooling, decided to bring back to just some basic concepts that provide high value.

Standard installation should be done using Angelo's site.  If you use CodeMix or DevStyle,
this version could also be used.
